This repo is forked from acos-server/acos-html to add support for SPLICE Content Protocol.

# HTML protocol

This protocol adds support to load activities
from the server into `iframe`. 

# SPLICE Content Protocol

The addition of SPLICE Content Protocol(SCP) support on HTML protocol enables the communication for grade passback and other log
events. Any consumer that supports SCP can serve content using ACOS HTML protocol and listen for grade (score) events. This 
is the main difference between the original acos-html package. 

More details about the SCP can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X6Vx6Em67t8Vp4Vecnmc-7OblVewJJKDFIJUrvRAvdc/edit
